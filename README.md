Two A.I developmental projects during my two-week internship at Pace University. One with developing an ANN for classifying 3 different kinds of butterflies out of a set of  75 with an accuracy of 76%. My dataset came from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phucthaiv02/butterfly-image-classification. Both projects were done with supervised learning at a learning rate of 0.0001. The second project was a GAN for generating butterflies taken from the data set. The learning rate for the discriminator and generator classes were again both 0.0001. Unfortunately due to hardware and time constraints the A.I generated noise with the sample size we trained it on, 5,000 images.
